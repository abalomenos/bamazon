### Note - You Will Need to Setup a MySQL Server
* For bAmazon to work, you will need a running MySQL server and will need to add the connection info for your server to a `.env` file in the root directory.
1. If you need to setup a MySQL server, please download and install the server from the following link: <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>.
2. Once you have your MySQL server up and running, create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following to it, replacing the values in the quotes with your MySQL server connection info:

```js

# MySQL Connection
HOST='your MySQL server IP'
PORT='your MySQL server Port'
USER='username for connection to MySQL server'
PASSWORD='password for connection to MySQL server'
DATABASE='name of Database on MySQL server'

```
